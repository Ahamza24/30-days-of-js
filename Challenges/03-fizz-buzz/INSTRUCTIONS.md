# FizzBuzz
Write a function that takes an integer n and returns an array of strings with numbers from 1 to n but with the following rules:

- For multiples of 3, return "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, return "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz".

## Example One
`Input:` n = 15
`Output:` ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]

## Example Two
`Input:` n = 5
`Output:` ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz"]
